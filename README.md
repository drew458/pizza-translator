A simple script that retrieves text from clipboard (a.k.a the CTRL+C boi) and translates it in Italian.  
It automatically detects the languange from which you want to translate.

## Prerequisites
Before starting the script, you need to install the following external modules through CLI (Windows/Linux/Mac):
* `pip3 install pyperclip`
* `pip3 install translators`
* `pip3 install translate`

More briefly, just run:
* `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

To run the script, `cd` into the folder and `python3 main.py`.

## Usage
It is really time-saving when you assign a keyboard shortcut to it. To do so, create a shortcut of the script, right-click it and give it your preferred keyboard shortcut.  
Note that this may conflict with other keyboard shortcuts in your operating system, so choose it wisely.
